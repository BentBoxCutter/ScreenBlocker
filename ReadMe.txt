ScreenBlocker

About
This is a simple resizeable screen blocker I created to block fixed ads in video content using WPF and C#.  
The motivation behind this was watching videos and streams with ads in the corners/side/banners.  Some of 
these ads were really distracting (flashing/moving/color changing) and I decided to create something to
hide them.  This program can also be used in fullscreen+not on top mode to black out an unused monitor.


Features
 - Drag to move from anywhere in the window (useful if the window is partially offscreen)
 - Resize the window from the bottom right corner
 - Change whether the window will display over top of other windows via the right click menu
 - Change whether the window is fullscreen via the right click menu
 - Open a new instance of the screen blocker via the right click menu
 - Close the window via the right click menu
 
 
 Future Ideas:
 - Add different colors
 - Add selecting an image instead of a fixed color
 - Allow command line args to control behavior on launch so different shortcuts can open different sized/behaved windows
